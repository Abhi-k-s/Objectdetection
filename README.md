# Objectdetection
Matlab Image Processing for Object Detection.
This is a Matlab Mini project involving image processing for object detection from a input video file by processing each frame of the video.
takes each frame of the input video file and detects the number of similarobjects(Books) present in that frame which determines the object count.
Blob Analysis Involved.
This Project can also be integrated with a Autonomous Library Management System for efficient usage of human resources needed in managing a library.
